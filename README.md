# Welcome!
 
## I'm Lucas Ricardo

Junior developer, working in the IT area since the age of 17, when I started the technical course of analysis and systems development in 2016, later joining the undergraduate course in information technology at PUC-Campinas, where I graduate at the end of 2021.

I worked in the most varied areas of IT, I have already provided support, intern in tests, freelancer, help desk, and now I am as a developer. I intend to build a career in the area, assuming responsibilities and exceeding goals.

If I'm not coding, I'm watching a movie, playing a video game or listening to music, I'm passionate about cinema and art, and I spend my free time writing about them.
